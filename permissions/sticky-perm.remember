The sticky bit has no effect on files. For a directory with the sticky permission, only the user owner or group owner 
of the directory can delete or rename files within the directory. Users or groups with write access to the directory, 
by way of user or group ownership, cannot delete or modify files in the directory. The sticky permission is useful when 
a directory is owned by a privileged group whose members share write access to files in that directory. 

The sticky permission can be set via the following chmod command (for example, for the mydir directory): 

chmod +t mydir
